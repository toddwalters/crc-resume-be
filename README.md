## Getting Started

## Special Notes

- The `params.dev.json`, `params.qa.json`, and `params.prod.json` files are required. They allow you to pass parameters and tags to your CloudFormation template.
- Your CloudFormation template must be placed in the `template.yaml` file. It is the only file executed by CloudFormation.
